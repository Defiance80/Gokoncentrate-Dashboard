# Claude Code Rules (GoKoncentrate)

- This repo integrates with another workspace.
- Before making changes, **read `INTEGRATIONS.md`** and follow it exactly.
- Do not invent endpoints, database columns, or field names.
- Keep changes minimal and non-destructive.
- If something is missing, stop and ask rather than guessing.
