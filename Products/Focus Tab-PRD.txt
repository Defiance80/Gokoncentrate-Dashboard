# GoKoncentrate — Focus Tab Specification  
**Purpose:** Provide a hands-free, audio-first experience that respects user attention while enabling personalized, continuous listening using existing media and data structures.

---

## 1. Core Concept

**Focus** is not a new content type or player.  
It is a **mode of consumption**.

The Focus tab enables **Listening Mode**, allowing users to consume select media hands-free (cooking, driving, working) where visuals are optional and audio carries the experience.

---

## 2. Eligibility Rule (Hard Requirement)

Only media tagged with the **genre `Focus`** qualifies for Focus Mode behavior.

- No other genres are eligible
- No auto-inference at v1
- Editorial tagging is the source of truth

This keeps the system deterministic, safe, and easy to curate.

---

## 3. Focus Tab Entry Behavior

When a user opens the Focus tab:

### If a session exists
- Show **Resume Listening**

### If no session exists
- Show **Start Focus Session**

The app must remember:
- Last Focus media played
- Queue position
- Playback progress

---

## 4. Listening Mode Behavior

When Listening Mode is active:

- Audio-first playback
- Video minimized or hidden
- Screen interaction optional
- Background audio supported (OS permitting)
- Auto-advance to next Focus-tagged media
- No non-Focus content allowed in queue

This ensures continuity and cognitive safety.

---

## 5. Personalized Focus Streaming

Focus Mode playback is **personalized per user** using existing signals.

### Personalization Inputs (in priority order)

1. **Watchlist**
   - Strongest explicit interest signal
2. **Watch History**
   - Creators frequently watched
   - Categories frequently consumed
3. **Search History**
   - Intent-driven topics and keywords

No new schema required.

---

## 6. Ranking Model (v1 — Deterministic)

Each eligible Focus media item receives a score per user.

### Scoring Weights (example)

- +5 → Focus item is in user Watchlist
- +4 → Same creator as frequently watched
- +3 → Matches frequent categories
- +3 → Matches search history topics
- +2 → Adjacent to last Focus item played
- −3 → Previously completed
- −5 → Previously skipped quickly

Queue is sorted by descending score.

---

## 7. Queue Composition Rule

To prevent repetition:

- 70% → Strong interest matches
- 20% → Adjacent/related content
- 10% → Wildcard (editor pick / new / trending)

This keeps Focus streams fresh but aligned.

---

## 8. Cold Start Handling (New Users)

If insufficient history exists:

1. Trending Focus-tagged content
2. Editor-curated Focus picks
3. Newest Focus content
4. Optional onboarding interest selection (future)

No empty states.

---

## 9. Focus Tab UI Layout (Minimal)

1. **Primary CTA**
   - Resume Listening
   - or Start Focus Session

2. **Secondary Section**
   - Recently played Focus items
   - Saved Focus items

3. **Micro-copy**
   > Designed for hands-free moments.

No feeds.  
No infinite scroll.  
No visual overload.

---

## 10. Allowed Enhancements (Non-Breaking)

These may be added later without refactor risk:

- Session duration presets (15 / 30 / 60 min)
- Headphone disconnect auto-pause
- Soft session completion cues
- Light “More like this / Less like this” weighting controls

---

## 11. Explicit Non-Goals

- No AI auto-classification at v1
- No new media types
- No schema changes
- No separate Focus player
- No visual-first UI

---

## 12. Strategic Outcome

Focus Mode transforms GoKoncentrate from:

> A place users scroll  
into  
> A space that accompanies their life

It reduces cognitive load, builds
