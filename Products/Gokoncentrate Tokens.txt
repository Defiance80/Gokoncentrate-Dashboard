# GoKoncentrate In-App Token System (PRD – Revised)

## Feature Name
**Koncentrate Tokens**

---

## 1. Purpose & Vision

Koncentrate Tokens are a **non-cash, in-app access currency** that allows users to unlock premium GoKoncentrate content incrementally.

Tokens represent **earned access value**, not money, while being internally valued in U.S. dollar equivalents for clarity, pricing consistency, and sustainability.

This system rewards engagement without introducing speculation, trading, or financial payouts.

---

## 2. Core Principles

- Tokens are **earned**, not purchased (v1)
- Tokens are **non-transferable**
- Tokens have **internal USD equivalence**, not cash redemption
- Tokens unlock **premium access**, not financial assets
- Tokens preserve the value of premium content

---

## 3. Token Definition & Valuation

### Koncentrate Token (KT)

- **1 KT = $1.00 USD (internal valuation)**
- Valuation is for pricing clarity only
- Tokens cannot be:
  - Withdrawn
  - Exchanged for cash
  - Transferred between users
  - Traded externally

This allows:
- Transparent pricing
- Predictable content valuation
- Simple mental model for users

---

## 4. Token Accrual Model (Primary Mechanism)

### Time-Based Engagement Earning

Tokens are earned through **active, verified content consumption**.

#### Base Rate
- **$0.01 (1 cent) earned per 10 seconds of qualified viewing**
- Equivalent to:
  - $0.06 per minute
  - $3.60 per hour of completed viewing

#### Conversion
- 100 cents = 1 Koncentrate Token (KT)
- Tokens accrue continuously and round up upon completion thresholds

---

## 5. Qualified Viewing Criteria

Tokens are awarded only when:

- Video is actively playing
- Playback is uninterrupted
- Audio/video is not muted beyond allowed thresholds
- App is foregrounded or in approved Focus Mode
- Viewer meets minimum attention heuristics

> Passive background farming is intentionally prevented.

---

## 6. Completion Bonuses (Optional Enhancers)

To reward **depth over duration**, the system may grant bonuses for:

- Completing full videos
- Completing Focus Mode sessions
- Completing full magazine issues
- Completing series episodes

Example:
- +$0.25 bonus for completing a long-form interview
- +$0.50 bonus for completing a Focus session

Bonuses are configurable and adjustable.

---

## 7. Token Accumulation Safeguards

To prevent abuse:

- Daily soft earning caps (e.g., $5–$10/day)
- Diminishing returns on repetitive content
- No rewards for replaying identical content within a defined window
- Anti-bot and session validation checks

---

## 8. How Tokens Are Used

### Premium Content Unlocking (Core Use Case)

Tokens can be redeemed to unlock:

- Premium video episodes
- Premium magazine issues
- Premium miniseries content
- Premium documentaries

Once unlocked:
- Access is **permanent**
- Content remains available across devices

---

## 9. Premium Content Pricing Model

All premium content is priced in **Koncentrate Tokens**, with transparent USD equivalence.

### Example Pricing

- Premium article: **$1–$2 (1–2 KT)**
- Premium episode: **$3–$5 (3–5 KT)**
- Premium documentary: **$10–$15 (10–15 KT)**
- Full miniseries: **$30–$50 (30–50 KT)**

Pricing tiers:
- Light
- Standard
- Flagship

Prices can be adjusted without breaking user trust due to fixed valuation logic.

---

## 10. User Experience Flow

### Token Visibility
- Token balance visible in:
  - Profile
  - Premium unlock modals
  - Focus tab (optional summary)

### Unlock Flow
1. User selects premium content
2. Modal displays:
   - Token cost
   - Current balance
   - Time required to earn remaining tokens (if applicable)
3. User unlocks or chooses to earn more

This reinforces transparency and agency.

---

## 11. Subscription Coexistence

Subscriptions remain available and offer:

- Unlimited premium access
- No token deductions
- Optional monthly token bonus (e.g., $10 KT/month)

Tokens serve as:
- A trial pathway
- A bridge to subscription conversion
- A retention mechanism for free users

---

## 12. Editorial & Creator Alignment

Creators benefit because:

- Premium work maintains perceived value
- Unlock behavior reflects genuine interest
- Token economics encourage completion, not skimming

This avoids race-to-the-bottom content valuation.

---

## 13. Technical Implementation (High-Level)

### Required Data
- User token balance (decimal-friendly)
- Accrued cents buffer
- Content token cost
- Unlock history

### Events
- Token accrual events
- Bonus award events
- Token spend events

No blockchain, no financial rails required.

---

## 14. Compliance & Risk Positioning

- Tokens are **utility-based**
- No expectation of profit
- No real-money exchange
- No speculative mechanics

This positions tokens as **digital access credits**, not financial instruments.

---

## 15. Rollout Strategy

### Phase 1
- Time-based earning
- Premium unlocks

### Phase 2
- Focus Mode bonuses

### Phase 3 (Optional)
